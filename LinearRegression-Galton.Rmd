This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(UsingR)
data(galton)
summary(galton)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))

plot(galton$child)
plot(galton$parent)

breaks = 100
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(galton$child, col = "blue", breaks = breaks)
hist(galton$parent, col = "blue", breaks = breaks)

par(mfrow = c(1,1))
hist(galton$child, col = "blue", breaks = breaks)
meanChild = mean(galton$child)
lines(rep(meanChild, breaks), seq(0, 150, length = breaks), col = "red", lwd = 5)

```

Average minimized sum of square deviations:
```{r}
mean_child = mean(galton$child)
sd_child = sd(galton$child)

points = 200
mean_int = seq(mean_child - 2*sd_child, mean_child + 2*sd_child, length = points)

rep_child = data.frame(matrix(rep(galton$child, points), ncol = points))
rep_mean = data.frame(t(matrix(rep(mean_int, 928), ncol = 928)))
sum_of_square_deviations = colSums((rep_child - rep_mean)^2)

plot(mean_int, sum_of_square_deviations)
lines(rep(mean_child, 2), c(min(sum_of_square_deviations), max(sum_of_square_deviations)), col = "red", lwd = 5)

```

```{r}
plot(galton$parent, galton$child, col = "blue", pch = 19)

```

```{r}
seed(1234)
plot(jitter(galton$parent, factor = 2), galton$child, col = "blue", pch = 19)

```

See how many data we have for each (parent, child) combination:
```{r}
seed(1234)
plot(jitter(galton$parent, factor = 2), jitter(galton$child, factor = 2), col = "blue", pch = 19)

```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
